# long-seven-seg

A program, inspired by [This video] (https://youtu.be/zp4BMR88260) by Tom Scott, that finds long words capable of being written on seven-segment displays.

This program solves the problem introduced in the video that there may have in fact been multiple words that were equal in length, by taking this into account when iterating through them.

It was a fun little 10 minute project, and I thought I'd share the result.

# Notes

The word list used can be found [here] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words.txt) and I highly suggest that you update the word list included to match the latest version. Optional, but might provide interesting results.
